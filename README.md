# Land-Use-Classification
This project explores various deep learning approaches to classify land-use categories from aerial imagery. I implemented and compared custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with powerful pre-trained architectures like ResNet and VGG. The models were trained on the UCMerced Land-use dataset, a collection of 2,100 aerial scene images.
